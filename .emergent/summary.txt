The previous AI engineer successfully executed a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the , transitioning from MVP to a modern design. This involved implementing a token-driven design system with , migrating numerous pages to new  components using a  HOC, and refining  for consistent navigation and aesthetics. Key additions included  for gesture support and extensive code cleanup.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed pending tasks, developing a  and  component, integrating them into , and setting up Storybook for component showcasing. Initial attempts at a TypeScript migration and visual regression testing frameworks were also established. A critical phase involved fixing a frontend build error related to  and  conflicts, and a TypeScript type error. After a user-requested review highlighted incomplete verification, the engineer created a  route to explicitly showcase the new components (BottomSheet, FAB) and performed thorough mobile testing to confirm responsiveness and functionality, ultimately preparing a final completion report.

The  aims to be a secure, flexible system for operational workflows, evolving from an MVP. Initial requirements included robust Role/User Management, granular Permissions, adaptable Settings, SendGrid/webhook integration, Developer Tools, a flexible Workflow/Authorization System, and strong Security & Optimization (MFA, API rate limiting, time tracking, analytics, GDPR). Twilio SMS/WhatsApp integration with role-based access was completed, and critical bugs fixed, achieving a 100% pass rate.

The explicit request shifted to a detailed UI/UX research for modern, trendy designs suitable for mobile and web, aiming for a fresh, cool, easy-to-read, and easy-to-use interface, leading to a Dark Mode First hybrid design blueprint. This included full implementation of the new UI across all existing pages and menu items, with future placeholders. The latest explicit requests involved implementing gesture support, performing code cleanup, and conducting comprehensive mobile device testing for the newly migrated UI. Finally, the user requested to complete all outstanding items from the pending tasks list, specifically Bottom Sheets, FAB, documentation, Storybook setup, visual regression tests, and full TypeScript migration.

-   ****: Custom React hook for managing bottom sheet state.
-   ** / **: New components for quick action button functionality.
-   ****: Updated to export  and  for centralized access.
-   ** / **: Modified to integrate  for task details and  for task creation, serving as a functional example.
-   ** / **: A dedicated route () to showcase the functionality of newly created components (BottomSheet, FAB).
-   ****: Updated to include the new  route and integrate various  components.
-   ****: Created to configure TypeScript for the frontend, enabling type checking and compilation.
-   ****: Introduced to house global TypeScript type definitions, improving code robustness.
-   ****: New directory and files (, ) for Storybook configuration, enabling component isolation and development.
-   ****: Multiple Storybook story files created for core design system components (Button, BottomSheet, FAB, Card, Input, ModernTable), facilitating component development and documentation.
-   ****: Created for Playwright test configuration, setting up the framework for visual regression testing.
-   ****: New Playwright test files for visual regression testing across authentication, dashboard, and design system components.
-   **Documentation Files ( files in  directory)**: Several new Markdown files were created to document the design system, component APIs, mobile UX, TypeScript migration, and overall project status.

<pending_tasks>
-   **TypeScript Migration (Full):** The foundation (tsconfig, type definitions) is set up, but the actual migration of  files to  is largely outstanding.
-   **Storybook Full Integration & Verification:** Storybook setup is complete with stories created, but its full runtime verification and potentially required addon installations are pending.
-   **Visual Regression Tests Execution & Integration:** The Playwright framework and test files are set up, but the tests have not been fully executed or integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the verification of mobile improvements. This involved taking screenshots of the  page and other parts of the application across various mobile viewports (e.g., iPhone SE, iPad) to confirm full responsiveness and functionality of the new UI, including the bottom navigation and swipe gestures enabled by .

The engineer also created a document  detailing where these mobile-specific enhancements are implemented and how they can be observed. This was a direct response to the user's explicit request to verify all mobile improvements.

Previously, the engineer successfully created a  page accessible at  to explicitly showcase the newly developed  and  components. This page demonstrates the 's different snap points (peek, half, full) and the functionality of the . This work was done to address the user's earlier concern that new components weren't visible in the main application flow due to a registration form issue, ensuring that the new UI elements could be independently verified.

Key components (, ) have been developed, integrated into , and documented. Storybook and Playwright setups are in place, and a TypeScript migration guide and initial configurations are complete, though the full migration and test execution are not yet performed.
