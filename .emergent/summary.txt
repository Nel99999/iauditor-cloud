The previous AI engineer successfully executed a significant UI/UX overhaul for the . This involved establishing a token-driven design system using , developing core modern components, and implementing adaptive navigation. The initial phase focused on migrating key pages like , , and , addressing user feedback on incomplete migrations. The engineer then systematically migrated nearly all application pages using a  HOC for efficiency. Recent work focused on refining  to ensure all original menu items and sections were correctly present and functional, aligning with the old layout's structure but with the new design. Finally, the engineer implemented gesture support using , performed code cleanup (removing unused HOCs and backup files), and conducted comprehensive mobile testing, confirming full responsiveness and functionality across various viewports.

<product_requirements>
The  is designed as a secure, flexible system for operational workflows, building upon an MVP. Core functionalities include robust Role and User Management, granular Permissions, adaptable Settings, integration with SendGrid/webhooks, Developer Tools, a flexible Workflow/Authorization System, and strong Security & Optimization (MFA, API rate limiting, time tracking, analytics, GDPR compliance). The application successfully integrated Twilio SMS/WhatsApp with role-based access, and critical bugs were resolved, achieving a 100% pass rate. The current explicit request was for a detailed UI/UX research to identify modern, trendy designs suitable for both mobile and web, aiming for a fresh, cool, easy-to-read, and easy-to-use interface. This led to a hybrid design blueprint, which the user explicitly requested to be fully implemented, including a Dark Mode First approach, with all existing pages and menu items migrated and future placeholders. The latest explicit user request was to implement gesture support, perform code cleanup, and conduct mobile device testing for the newly migrated UI.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX Design**: Modern 2025 trends (Glassmorphism, mobile-first, dark mode first), token-driven design systems, semantic components, Framer Motion for animations.
-   **Frontend Tooling**: Style Dictionary for design token management, Craco for CRA configuration,  for gesture support.
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT, MFA, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
-   **API Integration**: Twilio (SMS/WhatsApp).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database. The codebase is organized into  and  directories.



-   ****: This directory is foundational for the UI/UX overhaul. It contains all design tokens (), reusable modern components (), and higher-order components.
    -   ****: Manages design tokens (colors, spacing) via , generating CSS variables in .
    -   ****: Houses all new, token-driven UI elements like , , , , , and various navigation, skeleton, spinner, and toast components.  is crucial for wrapping existing page logic with the new design.
    -   ****: Initially contained , but this file and the  directory have been removed as  was unused.
    -   ****: Continues to be used for applying modern styles to legacy components.
-   ****: Contains  for centralized route definitions and  for managing routing logic and stability.
-   ****: Extensively modified to integrate the new design system. It imports , , and defines routes for all the new  components. Crucially, it was updated to use  instead of .
-   ****: Updated to support the new token-driven theme switching, likely managing  attributes for Dark Mode First.
-   ** / **: The core modernized application layout, replacing . It features glassmorphism, animated backgrounds, and an updated sidebar. Recent changes include incorporating previously missing menu items (Schedule, Documents, Developer), organizing navigation into sections (Main, Organization, Workflows, Operations, Insights, Resources), integrating  for gesture support, and adding a visual swipe indicator.
-   ** / **: The first page fully migrated, showcasing the new design.
-   ** / **: The modernized dashboard, integrated with  and design system elements.
-   ** (e.g., , , )**: Numerous components created to replace or wrap existing pages, leveraging  to adopt the new design efficiently.
-   ****: Updated to include  as a dependency for gesture support.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Documentation Files:** Create or update documentation as needed.
-   **Bottom Sheets Component:** Develop a bottom sheets UI component.
-   **FAB (Floating Action Button):** Implement a Floating Action Button component.
-   **Storybook Setup:** Integrate Storybook for component showcasing and development.
-   **Visual Regression Tests:** Set up visual regression testing to maintain UI stability.
-   **TypeScript Migration:** Migrate the frontend codebase to TypeScript.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the Polish Later phase, implementing medium-priority improvements identified after the main UI/UX migration. This included:
1.  **Gesture Support:** Integrated  into  to enable swipe-to-open/close sidebar functionality for enhanced mobile user experience. A visual swipe indicator was also added.
2.  **Code Cleanup:** Removed redundant code, specifically the unused  HOC and its containing  directory within . Additionally, backup files () were deleted.
3.  **Mobile Testing:** Conducted comprehensive testing across various mobile viewports (iPhone SE, Pixel 5, iPad), confirming that the new design is fully responsive, and all navigation elements (bottom navigation, sidebar, nav rail) are functional on mobile devices.

All initial product requirements for the UI/UX overhaul, including the full migration of pages to the new design, refining  for complete menu structure, and fixing navigation rendering, are considered complete.
