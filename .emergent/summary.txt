The AI engineer successfully guided the  through a significant UI/UX overhaul. Initially, the project focused on comprehensive research and blueprint creation, leading to a Hybrid UI/UX Implementation Blueprint. This involved establishing a token-driven design system with , building core components like buttons and cards, and implementing adaptive navigation. After a phase of testing and user feedback regarding incomplete migrations, the AI systematically began migrating all application pages, replacing old components with new, modernized versions ( files), often using a . The , , and primary  were key early migrations. The latest efforts concentrate on thoroughly updating the  component to ensure all original menu items, including previously missed ones like Schedule and Documents, are present and correctly organized into sections, mirroring the old layout while adopting the new design.

The  aims to be a secure, flexible system for operational workflows, evolving from an MVP. Initial goals included robust Role Management, User Management, granular Permissions, adaptable Settings, SendGrid/webhook integrations, Developer Tools, UI/UX enhancements, a flexible Workflow/Authorization System, and strong Security & Optimization (MFA, API rate limiting, time tracking, analytics, GDPR compliance). The application successfully integrated Twilio SMS/WhatsApp with role-based access, and critical bugs (privacy, workflow validation, role assignment, pagination, XSS sanitization, invitation system) were fixed, resulting in a 100% pass rate. The current explicit request is to undertake a detailed UI/UX research to identify modern, trendy designs suitable for mobile and web platforms, aiming for a fresh, cool, easy-to-read, and easy-to-use interface. This led to a hybrid design blueprint ensuring easy frontend changes and link/functionality stability, which the user explicitly requested to be fully implemented, including a Dark Mode First approach, with all existing pages and menu items migrated and future placeholders.

**Summary of important files and changes:**
*   ****: This new directory is central to the UI/UX overhaul. It houses all design tokens, reusable components, and higher-order components. It was initially outside  but moved to resolve import paths.
    *   ****: Contains , , ,  for managing design tokens (colors, spacing) via , and  to import generated CSS variables.
    *   ****: Includes , , , , , and various navigation, skeleton, spinner, and toast components. These are the new, token-driven, and animated UI elements.
*   ****: A new directory containing  for centralized route definitions and  for managing route logic and stability.
*   ****: Extensively modified to integrate the new design system. It imports , , and defines routes for all the new  components for page migration.
*   ****: Updated to support the new token-driven theme switching mechanism, likely by managing  attributes.
*   ** / **: This is the newly created, modernized application layout, replacing the old . It features glassmorphism, animated backgrounds, and a significantly updated sidebar and navigation. Recent edits focus on correctly migrating all menu items and sections from the old layout.
*   ** / **: The first page fully migrated, showcasing the new design with glassmorphism, animated backgrounds, and new input/button components.
*   ** / **: The modernized dashboard, integrated with new  and design system elements.
*   ** (e.g., , )**: Numerous new components created to replace or wrap existing pages, ensuring all application views adopt the new design. These often use  for efficient migration.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full migration of all remaining pages to the new design, specifically ensuring their content and functionality align with the modern UI/UX.
-   Refine the  component to accurately replicate the full menu structure, including all sections and menu items (such as Schedule and Documents) present in the original , and ensure correct navigation rendering.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is in the final stages of a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, focusing on migrating all application pages to a new, modern design system. Key initial steps, including the token foundation, core component library, adaptive navigation, and route stability, are complete. The Login, Dashboard, and main application layout have been fully modernized using , , and .

Currently, the engineer is specifically addressing user feedback that not all pages and menu items were reflecting the new design. This involves:
1.  **Mass Page Migration:** Creating new  files for almost all existing components (e.g., , , , , etc.). These new components largely wrap the original page logic with a  HOC to apply the new design system efficiently, and their routes have been updated in .
2.  **Layout and Navigation Refinement:** The most immediate task involves fixing . The AI identified that the new layout's menu was incomplete, missing items like Schedule and Documents, and lacked the organized sections (e.g., Main, Organization, Workflows) found in the old . The engineer has updated  to incorporate these missing menu items, add necessary icon imports, and restructure the navigation into proper sections. The current activity is focused on fixing the navigation rendering within  to handle these sections and ensure correct display and functionality.
